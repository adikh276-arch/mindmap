## Overview
This repository contains the definitive High-Level (HLD) and Low-Level (LLD) design analysis for PhysioMantra's move to a Hybrid Care model.

**Design Constraints:**
*   🚫 No new product
*   🚫 No new module
*   🚫 No internal workforce

**Design Solution:**
Hybrid Care is implemented purely as a **Configuration Mode** within the existing care flow, using an **External Assistant** as an execution proxy.
